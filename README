Installation
============

The program can be started right after decomprossion of the archive---
installation is not necessary.

To run JBeam a Java 6 VM is required (JDK or JRE version 1.6 or higher).

The standard language of the user interface after extraction
is english. The language is given from the entries in the
localisation file 'resourcen/locale.txt'.
This file can be replaced with an other language version.
A german localisation file is in the distribution ('resoucen/deutsch.txt'),
others can be created by the user if needed.


Lauching the Application
========================

The program is started from the installation directory by
calling the Java-VM with the option '-jar jbeam.jar'.
Some starting scripts for Unix- and Windows-systems are distributed.

Simply double click the file 'jbeam.jar' under Windows, alternativly.

JBeam can also be used as an Applet---see the file "index.html"
in the distribution.
